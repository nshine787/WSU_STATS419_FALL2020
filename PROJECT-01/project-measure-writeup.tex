\section{Research Question:  Are the Vitruvian Man proportions realistic? How likely are men to be close to these proportions?}
\label{sec:rq}

The Vitruvian Man was designed with certain proportions in mind.
Vitruvius was a Roman architect and in his writings he describes the
human body as a set of proportions of one's height. \newline

\begin{quote}
"the open hand from the wrist to the tip of the middle finger is [a tenth part of the whole height]; the head from the chin to the crown is an eighth, ... The length of the foot is one sixth of the height of the body... and the breadth of the breast is also one fourth... outstretched arms... will be found to be the same as the height"
\end{quote}

\citep{Vitruvius} \newline

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l c}
  \label{tab:vitruvian-props}
  \textbf{Body length} & \textbf{Vitruvian Man proportions}\\
  \hline
  Head height & 0.125\\
  Arm span & 1.000\\
  Hand length & 0.100\\
  Foot length & 0.167\\
  Knee height & 0.250\\
  Shoulder width & 0.250\\

\section{Data Description}
\label{sec:data}

The data was collected by approximately 30 students who are enrolled in
STAT 419 at WSU. Students were supposed to gather measurements from at
least ten people. The measurements gathered were: height, head height,
head circumference, arm span, floor to navel, hand length, hand width,
hand to elbow, elbow to armpit, arm reach, foot length, floor to
knee-pit, floor to hip, and floor to armpit. The measurements were
collected by having either the student or another measure the subject
with a measuring tape such as the ones used by tailors. Students were
also asked to record which side of the body the measurements came from.
Some students chose to gather measurements from both sides for the sake
of completeness.

The data from all students was then compiled into one dataset. The total
dataset contains 263 rows of measurements. Covariates for each row were
also collected. Each subject was instructed to identify their writing
hand, swinging hand, dominant eye, eye color, age, gender, and
ethnicity. The data collector then assigned a value (1-10) assessing the
quality of the measurements taken, and recorded the amount of minutes
that it took to complete the measurements.

\subsection{Summary of Sample}
\label{sec:data-sample}

The sample contained about equal parts male and female subjects.
Subjects identifying as white made up about 70\% of the dataset, the
next largest ethnicity was Asian, which contained about 15\% of
subjects. The majority of those sampled were in their 20s. There were
not many under 10 or over 70 sampled. Subjects who preferred their
right-side made up about 80\% of the sample. Most subjects had brown or
blue eyes --46 and 31 percent respectively-- with a a lesser number of
hazel or green eyed persons. The quality of the data collected ranged
mostly between 8-10 on a 10-point scale. Most data collectors took
between 10-20 minutes to gather all measurements required.

\subsection{Summary Statistics of Data}
\label{sec:data-summary}

By comparing tables below we can see that the average proportion for
both male and female subjects are about the same. However, the standard
deviations show that males vary more in arm span and shoulder width. To
a lesser extent males vary more with hand length as well. Females have a
more variable head.height proportion. Females also have a slightly more
variable foot length and floor to knee-pit length.

\input{tables/female-correlation-table}
\input{tables/male-correlation-table}

Male and female subjects have the significant positive correlations for
hand length and head height, shoulder width and arm span, and foot
length and hand length. This means that for any person if they have
wider shoulders, then they are likely to have a bigger arm span. If a
person has longer hands they are more likely to have a taller head and
longer feet. For male subjects there is also a negative correlation
between arm span and head height, meaning that those with bigger arm
spans are likely to have shorter heads. However, there is a positive
correlation for males between the height of the knee and the height of
the head, meaning that a male with a higher knee (or longer legs?) is
more likely to have a longer head. For female subjects there are
significant positive correlations between the height of the knee, and
both hand length and foot length. This suggests that females with longer
legs may have longer feet and hands.

This was a new page

This is a newline. \newline  Here is some more text.

Below are some example code that may benefit you in preparing your
document. \newline

\vspace{0.25in}

\noindent Please state your name: \hrulefill \newline I was born on
\hrulefill in \hrulefill \vspace{0.25in}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:my-model}
    Y_{jt} = \alpha + \bm{\beta}X_{jt} + \upsilon_{j}  + \varepsilon_{jt} ,
\end{equation}

\noindent where \(\alpha\) is the grand mean, \(\upsilon_{j}\) is the
fixed-time country mean, \(X_{jt}\) (country \(j\) at time \(t\)) is the
matrix of country-level observations for the vector of aforementioned
parameters \(\bm{\beta}\), and \(\varepsilon_{jt}\) represents the
residual idiosyncratic disturbance. Our panel data set consists of
repeated observations of countries over time. Therefore, we employ
cross-section time-series models. This approach redefines
Equation\textasciitilde{}\ref{eq:my-model} by subtracting time-demeaned
values. This \emph{within} transformation subtracts constant country
effects for the dependent variable \(\bar{Y_{j}}\), the predictor
variables \(\bar{X_{j}}\), and the intercept \(\bar{\upsilon_{j}}\):

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:my-random}
    (Y_{jt} - \theta \bar{Y_{j}}) = (1-\theta)\alpha + \bm{\beta}(X_{jt} - \bar{X_{j}}) +  (\upsilon_{jt} - \theta \bar{\upsilon_{j}})  ,
\end{equation}

\noindent If \(\theta = 0\), the model reduces to a basic pooled
ordinary-least-squares (OLS) model; if \(\theta = 1\), the model reduces
to a fixed-effects model; otherwise the model represents a
random-effects model. The pooled OLS estimation is biased if country
effects exist \citep{Hsiao:2003}. The random-effects model may be
susceptible to omitted-variable bias \citep{Wooldridge:2006}: bias
because a predictor was excluded from the model specification.
Conversely, the fixed-effects model is not susceptible to this bias as
it captures unobserved intracountry variation around its average
country-level ``fixed effect." Panel-data analysis commonly has issues
with heteroskedasticity, serial autocorrelation, and cross-sectional
autocorrelation.

You can even have a math equation inline. \newline In this section, we review the regression results to summarize our findings.  First, we examine each model for significance, and conclude the hypothesized models fit well with the data.  Second, we conclude that the fixed country effects represent consistent and unbiased parameter estimates.  Third, with the use of the \citet{Driscoll:1998} robust standard errors, we adjust any variance bias to ascertain the significance of these consistent estimates.  Therefore, we are able to make inferences about the hypotheses using our model estimates.  For ease of interpretation across these 12 models, we introduce $\betaSH{{ \ \ }M1}{Total}{1}$ as notation to refer to parameter estimate $\hat{\beta}_{1}$ (HDI) for the Total Sample and (M1) Model 1:  Main Effects.

Refer to the Appendices in section\textasciitilde{}\ref{sec:appendix}
where I am going to cite John \citep[pp. 2-3]{Tukey:1962}.

Here is a quote by \citet[pp. 2-3]{Tukey:1962}:

\begin{quote}
For a long time I have thought I was a statistician, interested in inferences from the particular to the general.  But as I have watched mathematical statistics evolve, I have had to cause to wonder and to doubt. [...] All in all, I have come to feel that my central interest is in \emph{data analysis}, which I take to include among other things: procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing the data.

Large parts of data analysis are inferential in the sample-to-population sense, but these are only parts, not the whole.  Large parts of data analysis are incisive, laying bare indications which we could not perceive by simple and direct examination of the raw data, but these too are only parts, not the whole.  Some parts of data analysis, as the term is her stretch beyond its philology, are allocation, in the sense that they guide us in the distribution of effort and other valuable considerations in observation, experimentation, or analysis.  Data analysis is a larger and more varied field than inference, or incisive procedures, or allocation.

Statistics has contributed much to data analysis.  In the future it can, and in my view should, contribute more.  For such contributions to exist, and be valuable, it is not necessary that they be direct.  They need not provide new techniques, or better tables for old techniques, in order to influence the practice of data analysis.
\end{quote}

\section{APPENDICES}
\label{sec:appendix}

\subsection{Data Provenance}
\label{sec:appendix-data-provenance}

As was listed in \ref{sec:data} the data collection was assigned to the
STAT 419 class at WSU, which is around 30 people. This can lead to some
discrepancies in the way that the data was collected. The data may not
always have been measured by students, but by the people which their
handouts were sent to. For the 10 people that I gathered measurements
for I measured seven people personally, and then had three others send
me their results by email. The number of data collectors involved can
also lead to different interpretations of what each measurement means.
\newline The data collector was given the option to pick which units
they wished to measure in, and the subject was also asked to identify
their preferred hand in writing and swinging, what eye is dominant, what
their eye color is, how old they are, what gender they are, and what
ethnicity they identify as. These covariates give us a better picture of
our sample. For example, since we have about equal amounts of male and
female measurements (\ref{fig:gender-plot}) we can make some
generalizations. But on the other hand, we do not have much diversity of
ethnicity in subjects (\ref{fig:ethnicity-plot}) so we can not
generalize our results as easily.

Some of the measurements seemed like they had more outliers than others.
This is likely because they were either entered incorrectly or they were
measured differently. The measurements with significant outliers are:
hand length, arm reach, floor to knee-pit, and head height. Hand length
was supposed to be measured from the tip of the middle finger to the
wrist. Arm reach is supposed to be the measurement from the floor to the
tip of the middle finger when the arms are pointed upwards above the
head. The floor to knee-pit measurement is from the heel to the back of
knee. Lastly the head height measurement is from the chin to the top of
the head.
