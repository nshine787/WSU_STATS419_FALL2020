## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(devtools); # devtools is required for function source_url() to work...
my.source = 'github';
github.path = 'https://github.com/nshine787/WSU_STATS419_FALL2020';
source_url(paste0(github.path, 'master/functions/libraries.R'));
source_url(paste0(github.path, 'master/functions/functions-imdb.R'));

```


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
